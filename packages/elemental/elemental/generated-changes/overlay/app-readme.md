# Elemental

Elemental brings to Rancher the ability to install and manage a minimal OS based on SUSE Linux Enterprise technology, delivered and managed in a fully cloud native way. 

The Elemental OS is maintained in container images and could be used to create bootable images and perform OS updates.

For more information on how to deploy an Elemental Cluster, follow the [official documentation](https://elemental.docs.rancher.com/).
